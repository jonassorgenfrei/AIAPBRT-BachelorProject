/**
 * Kd-Tree Accelerator
 * Binary space partioning tree (BSP).
 * BSPs can easily handle uneven distributions of geometry. 
 * (1) Splitting planes can be placed at arbitrary positions inside the overall bound 
 * 2) diff. parts of 3D space can be refined to different degrees)
 *  ==> diff Kd-tree / Octree
 *		Kd-tree:
 *			simply restrict the splitting planes to be perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes,
 *		Oc-tree:
 *			uses 3 axes-perpendicular lanes to simultaneously split the box into eight regions at each step
 *			typically by splitting down the center of the extent in each direction.
